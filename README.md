# Breast-cancer-prediction
This repository contains code for detecting breast cancer using logistic regression.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment 
and improving survival rates. In this project, i used logistic regression to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based 
on various features extracted from diagnostic images.

## Dataset




Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset contains real data from 699 observations, each with independent variables used to 
classify the dependent variable into malignant or benign. This dataset is commonly used for logistic regression analysis.

Source
This dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was originally created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick 
Street, and Olvi L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
